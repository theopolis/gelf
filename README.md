== Introduction ==
Gelf is a forwarding application that utilizes two producer / consumer FIFO queues, a client and server interface, and a web browser to connect the three.

This allows a simple web browser (HTML 4/5) to route data between two or more hosts. The initial use case for this application was as a mobile device 
tethering solution, where no code execution (aside from Javascript) on the mobile device is possible.
